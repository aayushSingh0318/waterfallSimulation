# waterfallSimulation

Project Summary

This project aimed to create a captivating 2D animation scene in Processing that portrays a dynamic forest scene. The scene includes background stars, trees, moving leafs, wind particles, rocks, and a waterfall stream. Each object in the scene exhibits simulation principles and forces to represent different behaviors within different objects.
File Structure

Ensure all these files are in the same directory:

group_9_a6.pde

Leaf.pde

Rock.pde

Tree.pde

Waterfall.pde

WindParticle.png

forestAudio.mp3

When you have all the files attached run the code. 

Launch Processing.
Go to File -> Open... and navigate to the directory containing the sketch files.
Select group_9_a6.pde and click Open.

Press the triangular "Run" button in the toolbar at the top of the Processing IDE to run the sketch and view the forest scene animation.

1. The user can click the window to introduce wind particles into the simulation. More clicks will add more wind particles
2. The user can press any key to turn on the audio of a forest scene. To turn off, press any key again
